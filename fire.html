<p>Here you will learn everything you need to know about fires. How to build, maintain, and transport fire. You will also learn how to be safe. OK. Let's begin! </p>
  <h1><u>Gathering Materials</u></h1>
  <p>No matter what fire starting things you have, if you have any, don't just start. Before anything, gather what you are going to need. You are going to need tinder, kindling, and fuel. You are going to want to collect a large amount of each. Tinder is the smallest type of material you will be collecting. Tinder can be dry leaves, dry grass, wood shavings, paper birch, etc. These materials will help start your fire off. Kindling will help you maintain your fire for a while. Kindling is usually small branches and broken sticks. Now, unlike tinder and kindling, fuelis meant to keep your fire going for a good couple of hours. Fuel is just small logs, stumps and other things of the sort.</p>
  <h1><u>Building a fire</u></h1>
  <p>Before you worry about lighting anything, build the structure. There are many different structures but I would recommend making a teepee or a cabin. To make a teepee, first you put down the tinder. Then you lean the kindling on the tinder. The final step is to make a teepee around the kindling. To make a cabin, first place the tinder on the ground. Then make a cabin out of the kindling. Then cover the cabin with the fuel.  </p>
<h1><u>Lighting the fire</u></h1>
<p>Now, you are going to want to start your fire. Whether you have matches or a lighter or a knife and a rock, you need to prepare something that will light easily</p>
